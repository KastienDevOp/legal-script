# 🧑‍⚖️ Legal License Programming Language (LLPL) 🏛️

## Because every line of code should be admissible in court! 🕵️‍♂️💼

Welcome to the most litigious programming language ever created! Are you tired of writing code that won't hold up in a court of law? Look no further! LLPL is here to save the day (and your assets)! 🦸‍♀️💰

### 🤔 What is LLPL?

LLPL is a revolutionary programming language that looks like a legal license agreement. Why? Because we believe that if software is eating the world, lawyers should get their fair share of the meal! 🍽️👨‍⚖️

### 🚀 Features

- **SUMMON** variables into existence (no subpoenas required!)
- **READ_EVIDENCE** from files (admissible in all digital courts)
- **DELIVER VERDICT** to output results (no appeals allowed)
- **DEFINE STATUTE** for reusable code blocks (precedent-setting functionality)
- **WRITE_VERDICT** to files (for the court stenographer)
- **CASE_DISMISSED** to end your program (and avoid a mistrial)

### 📄 Important: The "LICENSE" Requirement

In LLPL, your source code **MUST** be in a file named `LICENSE`. Why, you ask? 

1. It's legally binding* 📜
2. It keeps the lawyers happy 👔
3. It confuses the heck out of GitHub 🤪

Remember: If it's not in a file called `LICENSE`, it's not valid LLPL code. It's just plain old illegal code! 🚫👮‍♀️

*Not actually legally binding. Please don't sue us.

### 💡 Example

```
BEGIN_LICENSE_AGREEMENT

COMMENCE_LEGAL_PROCEEDINGS

SUMMON defendant
SUMMON accomplice

READ_EVIDENCE criminal_records.txt

DELIVER VERDICT The defendant's prior convictions: (defendant)

DEFINE STATUTE calculate_sentence
    sentence_length = defendant * 2 + accomplice
    DELIVER VERDICT Justice shall be served for (sentence_length) years!
END STATUTE

calculate_sentence

damages = defendant * accomplice * 1000
DELIVER VERDICT The court orders restitution of $(damages)

WRITE_VERDICT permanent_record.txt

CASE_DISMISSED

END_LICENSE_AGREEMENT
```

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository (no legal consultation required)
2. Plead the Fifth
3. Create a file named `LICENSE` with your LLPL code
4. Run `python legal_interpreter.py LICENSE`

### 🤝 Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! Please submit your pull requests in triplicate, notarized, and with at least two character witnesses. All contributions will be reviewed by our team of code lawyers. And remember, all proposed changes must be submitted in a file named `LICENSE`, or our legal team will object! 🧑‍⚖️

### 📜 License

This project is licensed under the "You Can't Sue Me" Public License. For more details, please consult your local library's legal section or a magic 8-ball. And yes, our license is in a file named `LICENSE` - we're not hypocrites! 😉

Remember: In LLPL, we don't have bugs – we have "legal loopholes"! Happy coding, and may the law be ever in your favor! 🧑‍💻⚖️🍀

P.S. If you're wondering why we're so insistent on the `LICENSE` file name, it's because we believe in hiding our code in plain sight. It's the last place anyone would look for actual code! 🕵️‍♀️🔍
