# 🏛️ LegalScript: Where Code Meets the Courtroom! 🧑‍⚖️

Welcome to LegalScript, the world's first programming language that brings the drama and excitement of the courtroom to your terminal! Are you tired of boring, conventional programming languages? Do you wish your code could object, sustain, and dismiss cases? Look no further!

## 📜 What is LegalScript?

LegalScript is a groundbreaking, tongue-in-cheek programming language that combines the precision of legal proceedings with the power of coding. It's perfect for:

- Lawyers who want to automate their courtroom antics
- Developers who've always dreamed of being the next Perry Mason
- Anyone who thinks traditional programming languages lack *gravitas*

## 🚀 Features

- **BEGIN_LICENSE_AGREEMENT**: Because every good program starts with terms and conditions nobody reads!
- **COMMENCE_LEGAL_PROCEEDINGS**: Initiate your code with the bang of a gavel!
- **SUMMON** and **SWEAR**: Bring variables to life and make them testify under oath!
- **LEGAL_LOOPHOLE**: For when you need to bend the rules of programming, legally of course.
- **OBJECTION_IF** and **SUSTAINED_OTHERWISE**: Conditional statements have never been so dramatic!
- **CASE_DISMISSED**: End your program with authority!

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone this repository of justice
2. Compile the interpreter (no law degree required)
3. Write your first LegalScript in a file named `LICENSE` (yes, really)

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

```bash
python interpreter.py
```

## 📝 Example

```
COMMENCE_LEGAL_PROCEEDINGS

SUMMON defendant
SWEAR defendant TO 0

COMMENCE LEGAL_LOOPHOLE
    IF defendant < 5
        SENTENCE defendant
    ELSE
        CASE_DISMISSED
    END IF
END LEGAL_LOOPHOLE

DELIVER VERDICT "The defendant has been sentenced (defendant) times!"

COURT_ADJOURNED
```
